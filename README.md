# letterboxd-to-trakt
this script allows you to sync your letterboxd watchlist with your trakt watchlist. 

## installation 
`npm install` and add a .env file with the following variables-

`TMDBAPIKEY`<br />
`AZUREACCESSTOKEN`<br />
`TRAKTACCESSTOKEN`<br />
`TRAKTREFRESHTOKEN`<br />
`LETTERBOXDUSERNAME`<br />

the trakt client id and secret can be generated by creating an application on trakt's website. tmdb api key can be similarly be acquired through tmdb's site. you'll only need azure access tokens if you intend to use the pipelines integration. follow trakt's api guide for authentication to acquire your first access and refresh tokens.

## running script
`npm run go`

## azure pipelines
this application is functional within the free version of azure devops project. running in pipelines will allow you to run the script on a set schedule. just be sure to create a variable library called `ApiKeys` and include the previously mentioned .env vars.
